An odd twitch, hearing loss,<br />
A ringing noise, new flesh,<br />
A new bump, A weightlessness, A headache, A sore limb,<br />
An Itchy Gash, A Mirage,<br />
A Tumor, A scare<br />
And when one is fixed, another breaks When some destroyed, more await When it is Time, no one comes<br />
When you have time, it is up<br />
And even from without<br />
There is nothing you will find<br />
Running at full speed<br />
Without a dent - factory shine<br />
Always slightly out of time<br />
Always Always dust<br />
Always Always Always<br />
No such thing as luck<br />
Only chance and rot<br />
Inevitable loss<br />
Running low<br />
Almost empty<br />
Almost always gone<br />
Going going gone<br />
Each day quicker<br />
Each day gone lost<br />
The more, the less<br />
The less useless<br />
That’s that, no more<br />
Meet me at the door<br />
It’s open, come in<br />
Wash away the sin<br />
No more lazy sloth<br />
This sad pig has had enough<br />
No nail grows yet<br />
All toes now green<br />
Both eyes blank screens<br />
Eyeballs opaque<br />
Robot ear gone<br />
Ringing silence<br />
Back again mate<br />
A tick tick, A shiver<br />
A lick lips, A stiffness<br />
A click limb, A limp useless<br />
Prick gone no need<br />
When stiff useless, when needed limp<br />
Rid me of the hideous thing<br />
Gets it right in the classroom<br />
But wrong in the examination hall What use is that? damn it all Useless thing<br />
All machines designed after it<br />
All worse, none better<br />
I.e. all shit<br />
None work forever<br />
None work a minute<br />
Worse with every use<br />
Always chasing the first<br />
Always chasing the free<br />
Always chasing decency<br />
Never adequate enough<br />
Enough, enough, come in, come in Thank you</p>

The greatest the world has ever seen, a genius among nonentities </p>
<p>The Leadweight clash of the century,<br />
February 31st, 2163<br />
I was there, but could not see<br />
Being a 3 foot 3 superfluous freak<br />
Blinded by necks, upper backs and knees<br />
Folded fat, flapped by the breeze </p>
<p>Sun Sugar, in the red trunks<br />
Sun Tzu, in the blue </p>
<p>Both ran to the centre of the ring<br />
While the rhinestone suit continued to sing </p>
<p>Sun Sugar, a simple man, cut from coarse cloth<br />
Sun Tzu, seeking strength from a snakeskin broth </p>
<p>“Weighing in at<br />
Six hundred pounds” </p>
<p>I ran through legs to the front of the crowd<br />
Sun Sugar came over in-between rounds </p>
<p>Sun Sugar came over shook my fucking hand<br />
He turned away, I shot him in the back<br />
Sun Tzu raised his arms </p>
<p>Crowned champ while Sugar bled on<br />
No doctor on the scene - the audience won </p>
<p>Eventually found, sentenced to life<br />
Spent reading the letters of a million wives<br />
Sun Sugar wouldn’t be shit without me<br />
The youngest executioner in tabloid memory</p>

Drying your clothes in the sun<br />
Alone, slowly burning<br />
Away<br />
I'm so thirsty I might die<br />
Thirty miles from the mines<br />
“Have you seen the drunken Captain singing?<br />
What d'you want to know?”<br />
“One more night in Absalom,<br />
Help yourselves men<br />
To Whiskey, onions and chilli<br />
Eat Men Eat!”<br />
Company A wake with a start<br />
Stomachs open, burning hearts<br />
With drills and lines this red liquid mined<br />
Captain bottles Rennie's red wine<br />
“Don't touch Rio Tinto's bottom line”<br />
Three long nights in those pits they called Hell<br />
Captain's food got me sick and oh so sleepy<br />
“I love you but I can feel my chest bubbling!”<br />
Oh so heavy and then<br />
Oh so light, almost something<br />
“And as they ran arm in arm from the burning crater Captain's screams echoed:”<br />
“You fucking faggots ain't seen the last of me yet<br />
I'll have the last laugh you cunts soon you'll see<br />
Each day you wake and each night you sleep<br />
I'll be camped in your chests<br />
Burning!”<br />
But we kept on running, turned our backs on old Hell,<br />
With wine in our hearts, hailed as saviours of Old -</p>

The sweet peals of moonlight-induced lovemaking on the streets tonight<br />
Listen! The soft purr of motorbikes<br />
Ready to strike up the night alight<br />
So don’t tell me of your troubles, your emotional grief<br />
Enjoy the sights this is shore leave<br />
Don’t talk of true love, unscrew your frown<br />
Enjoy the entertainments of nighttime town<br />
Experience the red rooms, the green tables, the souvenirs<br />
Make memories, haunting or fabled<br />
The gallant mist of red blooded chivalry<br />
Instilled in basic training<br />
By standing in line today<br />
You secure a place among the Saints<br />
Go get them son<br />
Now your life begins<br />
To die for your country does not win a war<br />
To kill for your country is what wins a war<br />
Don’t tell your name, don’t ask for hers<br />
In this land of oysters, you are the world<br />
The painless, plainness of military life resumes Tomorrow night<br />
If not for you it would’ve been cholera, malaria or some eastern disease<br />
Forget about it, son - a slap’s all you need<br />
We did it all we seen it all and worse much worse, son<br />
The massacres of ages - too many to recall<br />
Limbs rendered birds by the speed they flew off<br />
A soup nothingness that once was your best friend<br />
Motherless children and Temptress widows<br />
The Wild, The Useless, The Dead, The Untameable<br />
Snivelling fuck, staining this street<br />
Lucky I don’t shoot you on the spot<br />
bullets were made for men like you<br />
The impotent idiots god forgot<br />
Tonight you decide which corner takes residence<br />
Which room looms forever in your mind<br />
But now you’re on your own, we don’t need men like you<br />

That only a fool would try <br />
And stay <br />
If not for you <br />
If not for only you<br />
I feel sunk in a way <br />
You've been sulking all day  Our ships been sunk in the bay  But I can still find enough  Because<br />
I could have been  Bald with a baby  A Bald Eagle baby<br />
You've got me always wondering why  I'm worn out<br />
And if I ever needed love   It's now <br />
Just take me!<br />
Thinking stupid - <br />
I know it's late but please stay up  And talk to me <br />
Accept some kind of old defeat  <br />
I know a song <br />
That gives <br />
Everything that you need<br />
I went to see him  <br />
At the "Obviously Visiting" Arena  You were a mile away <br />
But doing so good</p>

    The Race is About to Begin<span class="btnset"><a href="https://blackmidi.ffm.to/hellfire.OWE">Listen</a> <a class="read" href="#">Read</a></span><div class="lyrics"><p>Idiots are infinite, thinking men numbered Don’t kid yourself - this isn’t news<br />
Let’s start with Tristan Bongo, alone at the race Conscription calling his name<br />
One more night of freedom<br />
The heiress high up atop the stands<br />
And the lines are open<br />
That’s Lucky Star, Eye Sore, Doctor Murphy, Sun Tzu, The Clap,<br />
Mr Winner, Spot, Wallace, Mrs Gonorrhoea, Perfect P, Deadman Walking and The Company Favourite.<br />
A son hands dad’s hard earned cash to the clerk And she laughs at the gall of the small guido lips: “Put it all on Spot, the kid’s already won”<br />
John-tiles smeared with last nights beer<br />
Reflect vomiting Chris who dreams his dream is near In the form of Mrs Gonorrhoea<br />
Reporter reporting the state of affairs<br />
Inwardly asks of his prime time hair<br />
Why it can’t quite rival the manes on these mares The smoothness can’t compare<br />
Gleaming appliances attract attention The raffle prizes too many to mention Displayed all over the stadium entrance<br />
Hypodermic needles, hidden under coat sleeves Of sweaty wise-guy money earning men<br />
In search of the horse to apprehend<br />
The race is about to begin The race is about to begin<br />
Blondie locked in 4 eyes arms Squirming like a dying fish That’s the last I can recall<br />
The race was ran<br />
Someone lost someone won<br />
I came and I stayed and the same ever since -<br />
Outside -<br />
 The freaks of the wilderness, open in spring The time before time was the time to sing Unidentified song surges through the brush Transcription futile, let alone the rush<br />
You miss when hunched and scribbling notes Here no journalism is ever in vogue<br />
Despite the attempts of doctors and saints None have recorded its heavenly grace<br />
But I stayed, I stayed, I stayed<br />
That race was ran 30 years back And each day since the same -<br />
Peel back the witness of a million catastrophes To see the spotty remnants each has left<br />
I forget in which cups I’ve pissed<br />
From which I can still drink<br />
Tonight Its so cold my feet are shrinking Groping around for the sides of my boot It’s no night for the blind<br />
With all these sirens I envy the deaf mutes<br />
Some killer on the loose again Some idiot at large<br />
Some Chinese moose again An excuse for the sarge<br />
No sirens, all silent The log cabin’s silent No killer either<br />
No creaks in the floor<br />
Log cabin, what cabin?<br />
A shack’s all I have<br />
Yes my cubbyhole’s stuffed with skeletons But my neighbours is stuffed with anthrax<br />
Where does that leave us?<br />
I came 30 years back<br />
From Salafessien, via South Schlagenheim To Sunterun and Sunterime<br />
The late Sun Sugar’s home town<br />
Buried not far from here<br />
My only friend<br />
Neighbour, what neighbour? My shack is alone</p>
<p>This pen, changing lives One line at a time<br />
Blindness? What blindness? Sweet blindness a little laughter a little silence A little magic a little kindness a little all over me.<br />
Yes me. The first, the last, the everything.<br />
No trace of anything<br />
No life no sin no fun no time no anyfuckingthing no one no yes no house<br />
no shack no a no b no c no etc no 1 no 2 no etc no school no life no work no time no book no art no point no truth no use no friend<br />
no know no knot no hole no birth no end no real no fake<br />
No king of this useless nameless non-land<br />
No end to this nothing nonsense non-song<br />
No day set for my saviours arrival, to carry me far<br />
Across green waters, above the sky or below the depths<br />
Among the white cloud or red steppe<br />
Or to fly forever in-between ends, or in-between in-betweens,<br />
Or in-between no-between, or no nothing no saviour no journey no end. 1000 years of no nothing hiding from nothing. No reason to hide sins. No reason not to sin. No reason to pretend. No reason to pretend<br />
there is not no reason.<br />
Oh yes<br />
Blondie ran on the track<br />
Four eyes got stuck in the rail<br />
The reporter was caught getting sweaty in the stable<br />
Blondie and brunettie and redheadie all already gone Yes gone never came never stayed<br />
Blondie gone. 4 Eyes gone. Guidos gone. Clerk gone. Chris gone.<br />
Tristan Bongo the man who never left. Tristan Bongo never left. Still here. I stayed.<br />
The clown can be a martyr The whore can be an angel The hack becomes a master The crass becomes divine The infinite, infinitesimal<br />
All sins irrepressible<br />
No use digging holes to hide<br />
The rupture comes and leaves no stone unturned So don’t wish for anything</p>

    Dangerous Liaisons<span class="btnset"><a href="https://blackmidi.ffm.to/hellfire.OWE">Listen</a> <a class="read" href="#">Read</a></span><div class="lyrics"><p>As a farmhand I had<br />
No aversion to killing<br />
But to murder a man in cold blood Was something entirely different<br />
One dawn, one spring One man came to me Out of tire screech<br />
Of a black MG<br />
Dark clad, upright, emaciated, lips curved<br />
He said, “My friend, would you like to make some cash tonight?”<br />
“Some people really are awful”, he said<br />
“This you can’t deny<br />
“Some people are as useless as lids on a fish’s eyes”<br />
No pistols, no blades - strangulation was how it had to be He could depend on the strength of a man of manual labour The perfect idiot for his need<br />
Persuasion-wise he had a real gift Temptation had me by the balls He sold me a dream and I fell in For no reason except I’m a fool<br />
To sign away eternity with one stroke<br />
A blind greedy hoax, the joke of all jokes<br />
I’ll tell you for free, it wasn’t like a pigs squeal<br />
Job done<br />
No word From any one<br />
I scoured the pool halls, the strip bars, the casinos<br />
No man skinny enough to vaguely resemble my friend who said,<br />
“We’ll meet at The Queen at 8<br />
10 grand in your pocket, don’t be late” No sign of the black clad gang man<br />
Front page news, “random killing - No gang affiliation, no mob justice - Murder”<br />
To see the bruised neck I wrecked, immortalised in print<br />
A Circle opened from the black and white picture and my search for that face was complete<br />
He climbed out the page and shed his skin, revealing the red king This was no mafioso, this was Satan himself<br />
True evil - the stench of an unknowable wealth<br />
“You’re coming with me son”, the cries, anguish, torment<br />
The shame, pain, heartache, suffering, futile regret</p>

    The Defence<span class="btnset"><a href="https://blackmidi.ffm.to/hellfire.OWE">Listen</a> <a class="read" href="#">Read</a></span><div class="lyrics"><p>When Crowds swarm out doorways And The street-lamps are lit<br />
One of my disciples<br />
Begins his wandering<br />
In alleys and Main streets He searches for men<br />
The virile, pathetic and lame<br />
Leading them in<br />
To our establishment He starts to cry Every night<br />
“Prostrate, supine Well groomed - divine! Whatever you like Please sir, tonight”<br />
A brothel is a business no different than a bank As safe and as formal and sanitary<br />
My girls all destined for hell<br />
Or so says our priest<br />
But find me a Christian<br />
Who spends as much time on their knees!<br />
Closer to god<br />
They honour his glory In the best way Everyday<br />
Without my aid they’d be in chains<br />
Or disembowelled in a backstreet lane I’ll stop selling when you stop buying ‘Till the end of time you will hear the cry<br />
“Prostrate, supine Well groomed - divine! Whatever you like Follow me tonight”</p>

     27 Questions<span class="btnset"><a href="https://blackmidi.ffm.to/hellfire.OWE">Listen</a> <a class="read" href="#">Read</a></span><div class="lyrics"><p>When lost in wild rain there is nothing you can do When lost in city rain there is something you can do Take refuge wherever’s marked admission free<br />
As we did one night in late ’63<br />
I’d never seen the man on the poster before<br />
But my friend said he was a big star before the war<br />
The boy by the door, louder than a bomb<br />
All the way down the street you heard his song<br />
“Roll up, roll up - tonight is the night Freddie Frost gives his last will live on stage Roll up, roll up for the show of a lifetime Doors open at quarter to eight”<br />
Sat in upholstery that was once brilliant,<br />
We picked its loose stuffing and looked around<br />
There were duchesses and dukes, and beggars and pimps All sat side by side to watch this last grasp at life<br />
The grand centrepiece was a gold-green sarcophagus<br />
Flanked either side by oil-painted pictures of the man<br />
First of all a film to explain his life-long dream<br />
Afterwards music started, and a young girl ran on with operatic screams<br />
Two hours went by and his 65 daughters<br />
Who told, through opera, of his life’s importance<br />
They sang of his exploits all over the earth<br />
His likes and dislikes, his undoubtable worth<br />
After a last crescendo where they all cried as one<br />
They hurried quickly off but the music played on<br />
From within the sarcophagus rose a spotlit weathered hand Mr Frost emerged and to the racing beat he danced<br />
With the vital energy of a newborn Chimp He spun and he spun and spun and spun<br />
Hopelessly wrinkled and by no means thin<br />
He soon became dizzy, regained his composure and started to sing...<br />
“Thank you for listening<br />
I won’t be too long<br />
Just twenty seven questions to finish this song...<br />
Does there exist a marriage that can survive castration?<br />
A future where a man can go a year without hydration?<br />
Is grass ever greener?<br />
Is the will really free?<br />
Is it only black you see when you join the deceased?<br />
Will I forever be a mediocrity? A hideous glut with trembling knees? In death will I see the girls of daydreams?<br />
Intangibly dressed, invisibly seamed?<br />
Will the sun burn out?<br />
Will my corpse grow a beard?<br />
Will my house be kept?<br />
And my sperm be reared?<br />
(My last shot at the big time posthumous paste will it find a home or go to waste?)<br />
In heaven do the morals of the earth still stand? Or can I bridge the gap twixt beast and man?<br />
Is there such a thing as a universal truth? Any lost secret to eternal youth?<br />
Do nuns fornicate?<br />
And scientists pray?<br />
Is a sin committed every moment of every day?<br />
That’s not quite 27<br />
But my chest feels awful tight<br />
So thank you for listening<br />
Good night, good night, good night”<br />
Freddie Frost blew up to the size of a hot air balloon Red as all hellfire and loud as Satan’s siren<br />
And he wheezed and moaned in pain as he rose But we all just laughed at the sad old oaf<br />
And laughed all the way home</p>
